# Wine Quality Prediction 🍷 
## Project Goal 🎯
The goal of the project is to determine if the quality of a wine can be predicted based on features such as:  
* __Density__  
* __pH__  
* __Residual Sugar__  
* __Sulphates__ 

## One Diagram to Rule Them All 💍

## Project Insights 🔍
* "Alcohol" presents the highest correlation with Wine Quality: 0.39
* "Density" presents the second highest correlation with Wine Quality: -0.28
* "Chlorides" presents the third highest correlation with Wine Quality: -0.18 
* "Total Sulfur Dioxide" presentes the fourth highest correlation with Wine Quality: -0.16

## Conclusions 💯

The data __indicates__ that the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm used was a __good__ fit, with the following parameters:
* __metric:__ 'manhattan'
* __n_neighbours:__ 11
* __weights:__ 'distance'
