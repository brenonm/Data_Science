## Conclusions üíØ
* The data __indicates__ that a __Logistic Regression Model__ is an __excellent__ predictor of whether or not a customer would click on this company's Ad.
* The data __also__ indicates the following relationships:  
  1) The __greater__ the Internet Usage, the __lower__ the odds of clicking on the Ad  
  2) The __greater__ the Time Spent on Site, the __lower__ the odds of clicking on the Ad  
  3) The __greater__ the Area Income, the __lower__ the odds of clicking on the Ad  
  4) The __greater__ the Age, the __higher__ the odds of cliking on the Ad  
  5) __Gender__ has __little or no relationship__ with clicking on the add or not  

* If the __company's goal__ was to target __older__, __low area income__ and __both genders__ of customers, the Ad seems to __perform well__.
* __However__, if the company's goal was to target any of these __specific groups__ or __any combination__ between them:
  1) Specifically __younger customers__
  2) Specifically __Men__
  3) Specifically __Women__
  4) Specifically __higher income customers__
