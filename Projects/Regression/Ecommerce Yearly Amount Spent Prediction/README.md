## Project Insights 🔍
* A 1 unit increase in Length of Membership increases 61.47 units in Yearly Amount Spent --> most important feature
* A 1 unit increase in Time on App increases 38.71 units in Yearly Amount Spent --> very important
* A 1 unit increase in Avg. Session Length increases 26.03 units in Yearly Amount Spent --> important
* A 1 unit increase in Time on Website increases 0.36 units in Yearly Amount Spent --> least important

## Conclusions 💯
* The data __indicates__ that if the company had to choose between focusing on its app or its website, __the app could bring greater returns__.
* __However__, the data also __indicates__ the __most important__ feature is __Length of Membership__,
meaning the company should focus their efforts primarily in __customer retention strategies__, such as:
  1) Loyalty program
  2) Personalized communications
  3) Personalized offers
  4) Re-engage customers through marketing automation
  5) Provide Excellent Customer Service (direct contact, feedback, surveys, social media listening)
